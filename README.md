# Gossip-Glomers Solutions

[Gossip Glomers](https://fly.io/dist-sys/) is a series of distributed systems challenges by Fly.io and these are my
solutions to them.
Although the original *Gossip Glomers* is intended to be solved in Go I have decided to use Rust instead simply because
I wanted to.

## Maelstrom

This repository includes *Maelstrom* which is the test framework that runs and validates
the different challenge workloads.
I made no modifications to it and it is a simple download from [github.com/jepsen-io/melstrom](https://github.com/jepsen-io/maelstrom).
